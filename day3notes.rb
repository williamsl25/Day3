# git - every time you save, git is saving a snapshot in that point of time of whatever you commit (changed/saved/added)
# everytime you make a change you can look at the commit to see what it was
# if you add it will turn green, if you take away it will turn red

# most important git commands 
# git status- will tell you what changes you have made/status of the file
# git add - you add files to the local repository
# git commit- will take the info that is ready to go to the repository
# git checkout
# git pull  will pull data from the server
# git push  will push data onto the server
# git clue
# *add, commit, push to get info on server
# untracked files - you haven't done anything yet
# changes to be committed- means that files are ready to be 
# added to server, pushed to server, changed in some way
# origin master -push to the server (git hub)
# git checkout will recover infor you added/changed/deleted by 
# accident from the last time that you did git commit (save)
# puts "What is your name"
