# git - every time you save, git is saving a snapshot in that point of time of whatever you commit (changed/saved/added)
# everytime you make a change you can look at the commit to see what it was
# if you add it will turn green, if you take away it will turn red

# most important git commands 
# git status- will tell you what changes you have made/status of the file
# git add - you add files
# git commit- will take the info that is ready to go to the repository
# git checkout
# git pull
# git push origin master - 
# git clue
# *add, commit, push to get info on server
